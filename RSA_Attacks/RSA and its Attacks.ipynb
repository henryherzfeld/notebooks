    "<p>The random fault attack works on the CRT implementation of RSA decryption. With CRT, RSA signing/decrypting first sends the message $m$ in $Z_n$ to the corresponding element $(u, v)$ in $Z_p x Z_q$. Exponentiation is done in $Z_p x Z_q$ where it is less computationally expensive:</p>\n",
    "$$x= u^d mod(p-1)(mod p))$$$$w= v^d mod(p-1)(mod p))$$<p>Afterwards, send $(x, w)$ in $Z_p x Z_q$ to the corresponding element in $Z_n$. This can be done using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, where we find $r$ and $t$, the multiplicative inverses of $p$ in $Z_q$, and $q$ in $Z_p$, respectively, so that:</p>\n",

This difference is equivalent to $0 (mod p)$, and just as important, this difference is nonzero. That is, $m - verify(s', pk) = 0 (mod p)$ and is nonzero. Thus, computing $gcd(n, m - verify(s', pk))$ reveals one of the factors of n. When we introduce even a single bit error in $x$ or $w$, we don't get the original message $m$ when we verify the corrupted signature.</p>\n",
    "<p>In this implementation, the CRT_rsa_sign function has a 'feature' that lets us introduce a bit error at a random position in either $x$ or $w$. Alice won't get the original message back when she verifies $s$'. The difference between this corrupted message and the original message is equivalent to 0 modulo one of the prime factors of $n$. Alice can recover the factorization by computing the gcd. This factorization should be equal to one of the prime factors of n.</p>\n",
